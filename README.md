## Project Overview
For this project, we analyzed the results of an A/B test conducted by Vanguard, a leading investment management company in the US. The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the impact of a new digital interface design on client engagement and completion rates for a specific online process.

## Project Context
As part of the Customer Experience (CX) team at Vanguard, we were tasked with analyzing the results of a digital experiment conducted from March 15, 2017, to June 20, 2017. The experiment involved two groups:
  - Control Group: Clients interacted with Vanguard's traditional online process.
  - Test Group: Clients experienced the new digital interface design.
The goal was to determine if the new interface would lead to higher completion rates and improved user experience.

## Results & Deliverables
After extensive data analysis and hypothesis testing, we found compelling evidence to support the effectiveness of the new digital interface design. However, further improvements to the interface design will be needed to achieve the minimum 5% completion rate improvement threshold determined by Vangaurd. Our analysis points to specific areas for improvement.

Our key findings and deliverables include:
  - Improved Completion Rates: Clients in the test group showed a significant increase in process completion rates compared to the control group.
  - Enhanced User Experience: Metrics such as time per step, error rates, and bounce rates demonstrated positive outcomes for the new interface design.
  - Data-driven Recommendations: Based on our analysis, we provide actionable recommendations for Vanguard to further optimize the digital experience for its clients.
  - KPI Analysis: We analyzed key performance indicators (KPIs) including process completion rate, time per step, error rates, and bounce rate. Hypothesis testing using the Mann-Whitney test confirmed significant differences between the old and new UI designs across all KPIs.
  - Data Cleaning & Merging: We implemented rigorous data cleaning and merging processes, including handling null values, grouping client demographics, merging data frames, and formatting date/time columns. Additionally, we created summary tables to organize and summarize the data.

## Conclusion
The Vanguard A/B Test Project showcases the power of data-driven decision-making in optimizing user experiences and driving business outcomes. By leveraging insights from the experiment, Vanguard can continue to enhance its digital offerings and better serve its clients' needs. We look forward to presenting our findings and recommendations to the Vanguard team.
